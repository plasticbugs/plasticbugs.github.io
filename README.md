# plasticbugs.github.io
A responsive portfolio site built with React

This site makes use of two typefaces which I've licensed from [Hoefler & Co.](https://typography.com) along with a CDN link from Font Awesome. If you fork this repo, you'll need to replace references to those font families in the CSS, remove the CSS link in the index's <head> to typography.com, along with the Font Awesome CDN link. If you do not replace the font references in the CSS, they will not render properly. Check out [Google Fonts](http://https://fonts.google.com/) for more typeface options.
